Brief justification:
- correctness: The code perfectly addresses all requirements outlined in the chapter content: it takes user input, validates the string length, prints appropriate messages, prints the first and last characters, and builds the string character by character using a loop. The optional bonus is not mandatory, so its absence doesn't affect the correctness score.
- readability: The code is very readable with clear variable names and well-structured control flow.
- performance: The code has optimal performance for the given task.
- security: The code does not have any apparent security vulnerabilities.
